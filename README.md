# Wikipedia Article Summarizer
A program that lets a user search for a Wikipedia article, then export a pre-defined set of summary information (title, thumbnail image, article images, text, and page URL) from the article to a PDF. If any information is missing, it is simply not included in the output.

Uses the MediaWiki API.
